    <p>After going through our advanced candidate finder artificial intelligence, and evaluating, sorting and practically interviewing over 4 billion potential candidates in less than a millisecond (we evaluate the development ability of everyone, developer or not), we have found the one PERFECT candidate for your company.  </p>

    <h5>Your Ideal Candidate Is...</h5>

    <p>Your ideal candidate is a Sydney based <%= @front_back %> developer named Rhys Diab.</p>

    <p>It's as if your development kindred spirits.</p>

    <h5>Rhys's Story</h5>

    <p>Rhys's unusal story starts at one of the most prestigious law schools in Sydney, The University Of New South Whales School of Law</p>


    <p>Like many top performing students Rhys was drawn to the most challenging course he could find. Law seemed like the perfect choice for his strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail. </p>

    <p>But while law satisfied Rhys's craving to solve difficult problems, it didnâ€™t take long to realise his passion lay elsewhere.</p>

    <p> Ass all his fellow students were seeking clerkships and graduate positions at large law firms, Rhys was searching for something different. </p>

    <p> Something in technology... </p>

    <p>The company for worked for built software which automated the creation of legal documents for small businesses.</p>

    <p>It seemed like a match made in heaven.</p>

    <p> But as time went on Rhys found himself spending increasingly more time with the development team. The technology, which was at the heart of the company fascinated Rhys to no end. </p>

    <p>Maybe you can relate.</p>

    <p>Maybe you know someone like that..</p>

    <p>Not long after Rhys made a move which shocked his friends, family and even his dog. Rhys made the jump into General Assembly's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp to pursue his true passion... </p>

    <h5>Rhys's Skills..</h5>

    <p>Since making the jump from lawyer to <%= @front_back %> developer, Rhys has proved himsef to be a <%= @description %> candidate. </p>

    <p>With experience as a lawyer, Rhys has strong a strong problem-solving ability, acute attention to detail and a high degree of emotional intelligence </p>

    <p>Rhys is fascinated by <%= @relevant_technologies %> and looking forward to joining a <%= @company_size %> team. </p>

    <h5>Why Today Is The Very Last Day We Can Guarantee An Interview With This Candidate</h5>

    <p>While we at Tech Talent Finder pride ourselves on being the best developer recruitment app in the world, the skill level and interpersonal skills of this particular candidate means he is currently receiving a TON of job offers. </p>

    <p>As much as he'd love to hear from you at some point in the future, It is likely if you don't contact him for an interview today he will be likely be employed and off the job market. (Lord knows that good ones don't stay between jobs long)</p>

    <p>And just like that the PERFECT <%= @front_back %> developer for you business will be gone FOREVER</p>

    <p>So it is important you click the button below and contact Rhys for an interview before it is too late.</p>

    <h5>Warning</h5>

    <p>Tech Talent Finder takes their success rate very seriously and will be forced to fire an engineer if you don't interview Rhys today.</p>
