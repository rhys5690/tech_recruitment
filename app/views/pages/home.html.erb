                <h5>Rhys's Story</h5>

                <p>Rhys's unusal story starts at one of the most prestigious law schools in Sydney, The University Of New South Whales School of Law</p>

                <p>Like many top performing students Rhys was drawn to the most challenging course he could find. Law seemed like the perfect choice for his strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
                </p>

                <p>But while law satisfied Rhys's craving to solve difficult problems, it didnâ€™t take long to realise his passion lay elsewhere.</p>

                <p>
                    Ass all his fellow students were seeking clerkships and graduate positions at large law firms, Rhys was searching for something different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Something in technology...
                </p>

                <p>The company for worked for built software which automated the creation of legal documents for small businesses.</p>

                <p>It seemed like a match made in heaven.</p>

                <p>
                    But as time went on Rhys found himself spending increasingly more time with the development team. The technology, which was at the heart of the company fascinated Rhys to no end.
                </p>

                <p>Maybe you can relate.</p>

                <p>Maybe you know someone like that..</p>

                <p>Not long after Rhys made a move which shocked his friends, family and even his dog. Rhys made the jump into General Assembly's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp to pursue his true passion...
